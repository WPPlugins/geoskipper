When linked to your GeoSkipper account this plugin allows you to specify which pages GeoSkipper should be active on.


== Description ==

GeoSkipper allows you to specify links and/or text to display to your visitors based
on their location.  This content can be shown in a slide-out tab or via a full
page overlay.

Other options include

* Redirect a visitor to a specific page based on their location


You'll need a [GeoSkipper account](http://geoskipper.com/) to use this functionality.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I find my Site Id? =

When viewing your site listing on account.geoskipper.com click "Get Code Snippet" and your
Site Id is the number after /geo/.   You will also see it in the URL.   We'll add a separate
Site Id display to this page in the near future.

= Does it make sense to put GeoSkipper on all my pages? =

In most cases GeoSkipper makes the most sense on your landing page.  The
plugin allows you to place it on any page/post, the blog listing or your static homepage
when applicable.  There is also an option to put it on all pages but make sure this is what
you really want.
